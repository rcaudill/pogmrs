For all intents and purposes a thought exercise in implementing reliable data communications over cheap radio hardware with as little external circuitry as possible. Ideally i/o will be done using the sound card thus allowing implementation over a wider variety of mediums. I do foresee controlling transmission being an issue that may only be solved by breaking open a radio, but that is a bridge to cross later. Again, this is a thought experiment. Any implementation which violates any laws is the sole responsibility of the implementor.
